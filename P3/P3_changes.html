        <h2>Administrative Details </h2>
        <p>Our client is Andreas Ore Larssen, the creator and owner of Vexi. </p>
        <p><b>Link to our website: </b><a href="../../Backup/WebTech/P3/index.html">Vexi</a></p>

        <h2>Changes we have made </h2>

        <p><b>The changes to index.html: </b> For visual reasons, the title and subtitle are not included. Instead the
            title is added higher on the site. The main reason for this was the scrolling-functionality which wasn’t
            obvious for the user. To get the user to actually scroll downwards, the “map” had to be visible from the
            top. We also had to remove the product overview under the title because of this. We decided and concluded
            that the information in the scrollable road would be enough to understand the product.
            <br><br>
            The side menu is also different from the first draft. It started out with “Front page”, “Testimonials”,
            “User journey” and a open feature if needed. We kept the “Front page” button, but called it “Home” to get to
            the top. The other buttons is replaced with the different features of the Vexiapp. These are: “Tell your
            friends”, “Get in touch”, “Hitch a ride” and “Settle the trip”. These contains screenshots of the app and
            some information describing it. The reason for no testimonials is that our client didn’t provide us with
            any. It is of course possible to add testimonials later on, by extending the “road” or have another one
            under the features. The “User journey” button is now transformed to the four features on the “road”, so it
            is possible to navigate the page easier. These are not clickable, by input from a meeting with our client.
            That way, it is not possible to place yourself in a weird position on the site. The color scheme of
            index.html is kept, but the buttons have gotten a background instead of plain text. This background color is
            RGBA to make it visually softer and nicer.

        </p>

        <p><b>Changes to contact.html: </b> From the pictures in P2, the plan was to try to make a rolling ball which
            hits the send-button. This is changed, because of a more simpler approach. The contact page is relatively
            close to what we described from the start. It does contain the form for contacting customer service, and the
            job application ended up being info on how to send a mail to Vexi and what it should contain. A footer was
            also added to keep some additional information and to make an extra visual expression. To make the contact
            page more appealing, we added a picture of Andreas. The background used is the same background as the
            roadmap.html background which was planned, but not mentioned in P2.
        </p>

        <p><b>Changes to roadmap.html: </b> </p>

        <p><b>Changes to css: </b> From P2, we were going to have four css documents. This was later changed to only
            style.css, by the project requirements. This document styles the whole site, and is consequently pretty long.
        </p>

        <p><b>Changes to scripts: </b> The names for the scripts are different, but contain the same information as
            planned. We now have a file for feedback from form, a file for the scrolling and a general script for the
            Vexi site. </p>
