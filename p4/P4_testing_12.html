      <h2>Testing Document: A brief summary of the questionnaire </h2>
      <p>We chose not to use a google form, as we think live testing is even more efficient. In fear of guiding the testers too much, the pre-given questions were meant to do nothing more than create the foundation of the talk. Comments and additional questions were asked and made up on the spot, dependent on the user and situation. The following questions created the base of the test sessions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What is you immediate thoughts about the main function of this application?</li>
            <li>Who do you think this application is suited for?</li>
            <li>If you wanted more information now, what would you do?</li>
            <li>Let’s say there was something you wanted to ask Vexi. What would be your approach?</li>
            <li>What do you think Vexi’s plans are for future updates? Use the application and find out. </li>
            <li>How would you navigate back to the homepage?</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
      <p>After going through the application together with the tester:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Now, would you explain the purpose of the application again?</li>
          <li>Who do you now think this application is suited for?</li>
          <li>Would you be interested in using the application - in what situations?</li>
          <li>Would a change in the interface make you want to use the application even more? In this case, what could these changes consist of?</li>
          <li>Would you apply for a job at Vexi? Would a change in the interface make you want to apply even more? In this case, what could these changes consist of?</li>
          <li>What do you think about the all over navigation? Could anything have been done differently?</li>
        </ul>

    <section id = "audience">
      <h2>Tester Audience </h2>
      <p>
        Appropriate to our target audience, our testing audience was found in the following places. NTNU Gløshaugen, Trondheim Torg and Work-Work. Our main audience was found in the cafeterias of NTNU, realfagskantinen and hangaren, respectively - more specifically 45%. At Trondheim Torg, the amount of people within our target group was not as expected. Trondheim Torg mostly consisted of people not in our defined age-range. However, a few people were representative, in fact 10% of our final audience. 22% of the total audience group were found at Work-Work. This was a very positive experience, as most of the people here were thrilled to help us testing our website. Lastly, we have tested on our roommates, representing the resulting 23%.

    <section id = "platforms">
        <h2>Testing Platforms </h2>
        <p>Some of the testers have been testing the website using their own phones. This way, the total phone types used in the testing sessions, are the following types: iPhone 8, iPhone 7 (note that iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 have the same screen size..), Galaxy note and Galaxy S7. </p>
        <p>In general, the test sessions have been conducted on Sondre’s iPad.. In addition, when testing on our roommates, the following computers were used, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, ASUS Zenbook Pro... </p>

    <section id = "feedback">
      <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
    <p>In this section, meaningful feedback is listed in bullet points. It is important to point out that most of the comments are redundant - they have been repeatedly commented from different testers. The responds to the first question was that most of the testers did not quite catch the main purpose of the application, partly because it was not obvious that one needed to scroll down in order to receive more information. However, whenever actually reaching the scroll section in the homepage, the testers commented on is being a fun and intriguing description of the application in addition to serving a very good user experience. Another reason to why the purpose of the application was not obvious, was that the content was not fully and explicitly communicated. </p>

    <p>Another common response was concerning the top left area in the Contact- and RoadMap-sites. Here, the vexi-illustration seem to appear as a back-button. When asked to navigate back to the homepage, the testers tried tapping and clicking on this section without any response. </p>

    <p>One tester responded that the including the picture of the founder of Vexi in the Contact-page, revealed a young boss, creating a less professional impression of the application. Lucky our client does not take himself too seriously, and was nothing but humored by this comment. </p>

    <p>The overall response was that the application had easy to use, navigable sites and created a good overview of the application and its functionalities. The design was fun and cool, apart from a few “swedish color-jokes”. Lastly, the content could have been expressed in a more explicit way. </p>

    <section id = "responds">
      <h2>Our Responds to the Feedback</h2>
      <p>Some of the testing and wrapping up the final code was done simultaneously. A few of the members of our group could not help themselves, the urge to tweak parts of the design and code based on the given feedback was simply too big. The client was also very happy about the decision of acting on the feedback. In order to obtain a more understandable index-page, the scroll section needed to be more visible from the top of the page. We decided to remove the top section of the page (see content section in P2 for visualization), and have the scroll section visible from the top.</p>

      <p>Concerning the top left area in the Contact- and RoadMap-sites with the vexi-illustration appearing as a back-button, our solution was simply to make this section function as a “back to homepage-button”. </p>

      <p> As a few of the comments were based on the message not being too clear, an additional solution could be having an even smaller section on the top, describing the product with two lines. We also thought about catching the users attention by asking a question; “Are you tired of walking home? This solution could be the answer! In addition to getting a ride, you get to spend quality time with your friends! Intrigued yet? Scroll down and find out more!” </p>
