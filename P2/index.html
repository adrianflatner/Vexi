      <h2>Purpose, goals, and audience </h2>
      <p>The site’s purpose is to promote Vexi. The goal is to get new customers/users of the app and to spread awareness of its usefulness. The page should also show examples of how the app is used and show user reviews(promotion). Our goal is to help Andreas and Vexi in spreading the sharing economy movement by displaying information about how this application is both useful and economically and environmentally friendly while staying inside the bounds of the law. A goal more specific to the group would be to create something that Andreas later will use when he decides it is time to make a live website and implement the needed backend features.</p>

      <h2>Page Layout and Appearance </h2>
      <p>
        Our focus when designing the Vexi page has been to recreate the general feeling and utility of the application. A visitor of the page should be exposed to a visual experience encapsulating the design of Vexi. Andreas has a desire to present Vexi as both friendly and playful. To encapsulate the feeling of catching a ride with Vexi we have focused on the dynamic of the page. Because we want as much of the content as possible to be located at the front page we have directed our focus to developing the design and flow of this page.
        <br></br>
        The general design of the page has a navigation bar at the top of the page. This bar will contain the Vexi logo (with link to the home page), a “home page” option and “about us” option. The idea behind the navbar is to keep it as clean and simple as possible while still making it look good. We want the visitor to feel that the page is safe but intriguing, just like the application.

          </ul></li>
          <li>Title: The title will be “Vexi”, and will be located at a eye-catching spot on the front page. </li>
          <li>Nabar: The navbar will be located at the top of the page. When a user is visiting one of the pages the name of this page in the navbar will become a darker shade to indicate that this is the current location.</li>
          <li>Background: The background will be an image containing Vexi’s two main colors. This is a simple image that splits the page visually in two. This is the layout that we will build the components of the “ride” on top of.</li>
          <li>Scroller: On the main page there will be a scroller with in-page links on the right side to make it easier for visitors to jump to different blocks of content on the page.</li>
          <li>Logo: Vexi’s logo will be located in the navbar on the left hand side. It will contain a link that takes you back to the front page if you click it.</li>
